Quantum random numbers are derived from the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics, which is fundamentally different from the pseudo-randomness of classical algorithms. The program leverages a single qubit and applies a Hadamard gate to place the qubit into a superposition state. When measured, the qubit collapses into either ∣0⟩ or ∣1⟩ with equal probability, producing a truly random bit. This randomness is captured by simulating the circuit on Qiskit's AerSimulator backend."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pip install
